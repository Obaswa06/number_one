                         swords, the Demon Slayer Corps fights to stop the devastation demons spread. <br>
                         Giyu Tomioka, the sole Water Hashira, and Kyojuro Rengoku, a high-ranking Kinoe,<br> 
                         embark on missions to eliminate demons and prove their mettle as two of the<br> 
                         fiercest Demon Slayers.<br>

                        Giyu heads north to an area where a band of hunters was killed.<br> 
                        He and the Insect Hashira meet Yae, the daughter of a slain hunter, <br>
                        who believes a bear killed her father, but the truth is harder to face.<br> 
                        Kyojuro also receives his newest assignment and hopes completing it will <br>
                        prove he's worthy of the title Flame Hashira, which his father abandoned. <br>

             <center><br><h3>There are probably some of you out there who are into Japanese anime. Well I recently started watching the Japanese anime <br> 
                called, “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba”. It is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotōge, and it is<br>
              about Tanjiro Kamado, a young boy who becomes a demon slayer after his family is slaughtered and his younger sister Nezuko <br>
              is turned into a demon. I wasn’t sure what the hype was all about until I started watching the anime with my 8-year-old son, who actually<br> 
              started watching the anime way before me.<br><h3></h3></center>

e       <center><h3><The image below is of Tanjiro.</center><br></h3>

                <p><center>
                   <h3> Though quite difficult to explain, Tanjiro and another character Tomioka use what’s called, “Mizu no Kokyuu” which is a kata using a katana,<br>
                     creating what appears to be a water wheel of water. Total concentration is needed to perform mizu no kokyuu. <br>
                     The image below shows Tanjiro using the mizu no kokyuu to fight off a demon<br><br></h3>

                </center></p>

                <p><center>
                    <h3>And after watching the first episode, I got hooked on the intro song. If you who are interested in Japanese pop music, the intro song <br>
                    is a must hear. The title is, “Gurenge” by Lisa, a Japanese singer-songwriter. There is an English version which you can find on YouTube,<br>
                     but I prefer the original, no offense of course.<br>
                     I would love to write more about Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba but I’ll end here, leaving you in suspense. I hope you get to watch it soon.<br>
                      I’m about to start on watching the twentieth episode.<br>
                      If you are signed up with any of the major streaming services then you should be able to find it there. It is worth watching.<br></h3>
